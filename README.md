Welcome to the Apto Android Mobile SDK. This SDK provides access to Apto's Mobile API, and is designed to be used for mobile apps. When using this SDK, there is no need for a separate API integration. All the API endpoints are exposed as simple-to-use SDK methods, and the data returned by the API is already encapsulated in the SDK and is easily accessible.

For more information about the SDK and deployment, see the [Android Mobile SDK docs](https://docs.aptopayments.com/docs/sdks/Android/mobile_sdk_android)
